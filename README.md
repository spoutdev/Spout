What is Spout?
--------------
Spout is an open-source implementation of the [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server software written in Java, originally forked from Tad Hardesty's [Glowstone](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/Glowstone) project, which was originally forked from Graham Edgecombe's now-defunct [Lightstone](https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/lightstone) project.

The official server software has some shortcomings such as the use of threaded, synchronous I/O along with high CPU and RAM usage. Spout aims to be a lightweight and high-performance alternative.

Spout's goal and focus is to offer a higher performance server that implements the universal [SpoutAPI](https://github.com/SpoutDev/SpoutAPI) client/server platform. The [Vanilla](https://github.com/VanillaDev/Vanilla) plugin can be used to implement Minecraft functionality. Bukkit plugin compatibility will be possible through the [BukkitBridge](https://github.com/SpoutDev/BukkitBridge).
